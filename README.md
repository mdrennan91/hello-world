# Overview

This is a "Hello World" program created as the first step in building my personal software portfolio. It helps confirm my development environment is set up and connected to GitHub.

The software itself prints has a print statement that displays "Hello World" in the terminal.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code to write and run the code, and Git to manage version control and upload the project to GitHub.

The program is written in Python, using a single `print()` statement.
