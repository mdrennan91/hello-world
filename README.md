# Overview

This is a "Hello World" program created as the first step in building my personal software portfolio. It helps confirm my development environment is set up and connected to GitHub.

The software itself prints "Hello World" to the screen. While it's a small first step, it represents the beginning of applying software engineering practices to everything I build moving forward.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code to write and run the code, and Git to manage version control and upload the project to GitHub.

The program is written in Python, using a single `print()` statement.
